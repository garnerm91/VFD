# Futaba VFD Controlled in Arduino
This is an Arduino-based project using Futaba vacuum fluorescent displays.  In this project, I used Futaba part number BL-141G (GM part number 09367240), a MIC5891 to drive the screen, and an Arduino.

This project was sponsored by JLC PCB Check them out at https://jlcpcb.com/IAT 

Board files and footprint will be added soon once the circuit board is fixed.  ETA 10/30/21 
Design work was done in Kicad
