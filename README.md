# Futaba VFD Controlled by Arduino
This is an Arduino-based project using Futaba vacuum fluorescent displays.  In this project, I used Futaba part number BL-141G (GM part number 09367240), a MIC5891 to drive the screen, and an Arduino. This Vacuum Fluorescent Display is off of a 03-05 GM Truck Instrument Clusters and on Trailblazers. The Arduino code is a rough sketch to get started with but functions well. 

This project was sponsored by JLC PCB Check them out at https://jlcpcb.com/IAT 

Board files and footprint will be added once the circuit board is fixed.  ETA 10/30/21 I will have a follow up video once that is done.
Design work was done in Kicad

# Goal
The goal of this project to make footprints and working examples of existing VFDs that are "out in the wild". Unfortunately Futaba would not providde datasheets. This project guide contains the files necessary to help you step by step produce your own PCB using the screens

# Screens
Right now the only screen supported is Futaba BL-141G. I do have access to more of them and will add support over time.
